## Overview

These instructions are to allow developers and customers install 3Blades on an AWS EC2 instance. A few notes about how this installation works:

- Uses ansible playbook to download, install and configure artifacts, such as docker engine.
- Docker images are pulled from AWS ECR registry.
- All images communicate with each other using docker links.
- All services and data stores run in separate containers.

You could do all of this with docker-compose. As a matter of fact, the ansible script does use docker-compose to launch and link services. However, we chose to use ansible since it provides more customization options.

## Preparation

1. Launch EC2 instance within your AWS account using the these requirements.

  - Ubuntu 16.04 AWS AMI (ami-a9d276c9)
  - t2.Medium (2 CPU and 4 GB RAM)
  - Security group with the following in-bound rules:
	- 22, 80, 5000, 8000
  - SSH key
  - 30 GB of disk space

1. Install ansible on your local computer:

    `pip install ansible`

    > It is recommended to install ansible from `virtualenv` environment

    > If installing ansible with Linux (Debian or Ubuntu), using Vagrant (VirtualBox) or other virutal machine you may have to install openssl dependencies: `sudo apt-get install build-essential libssl-dev libffi-dev python-dev`

1. Clone deployment repo:

    `git clone https://github.com/3Blades/deployment.git`

1. Change directory into project folder:

    `cd deployment`

1. Change directory into on-premise folder:

    `cd on-premise`

1. Copy / Paste SSH key into folder and add permissions to read SSH file:

    `chmod 600 SSH_KEY`

1. Test your SSH access into EC2 instance with external ip address:

    `ssh -i key-name ubuntu@[ip_address]``

    > Both external and internal IP addresses can be obtained from AWS console

1. Edit `hosts` file. Change your `IP address` and `SSH key path` for the host you wish to connec to to:

    `demo ansible_ssh_host=IP_ADDRESS ansible_ssh_user=ubuntu` `ansible_ssh_private_key_file=SSH_KEY_PATH`

    > SSH_KEY_PATH would reflect the relative or absolute path of your SSH key file

## Installation

1. From the `on-premise` folder, run ansible playbook:

    ```
    ansible-playbook -s -i hosts full-stack-deployment.yml \
    --extra-vars "target=demo aws_access_key_id=AWS_KEY_ID aws_secret_access_key=AWS_SECRET_KEY \
    aws_default_region=us-east-1 force_pull_images=yes smtp_server=SMTP_HOST smtp_username=SMTP_USERNAME \
    smtp_password=SMTP_PASSWORD app_secret_key=APP_SECRET_KEY"
    ```

Please, consider this:

- `AWS_SECRET_KEY` and `AWS_KEY_ID` are provided to you by 3blades administrator directly.
- `APP_SECRET_KEY` should be a securely generated random string.
- `SMTP_HOST`,Â `SMTP_USERNAME` and `SMTP_PASSWORD` values are used to authenticate to SMTP service. 3Blades SMTP credentials are available upon request and are necessary to enable system notifications, including password reset emails.

You'll have to wait several minutes for the playbook to complete.

## First login

1. Once the playbook completes successfully, you'll be able to loign to the application. Use the following credentials

     admin@admin.com
     admin
     > Make sure you select `Remember me` option

1. You'll be asked to change your password immediately. Provide the old password and a new one, then click `Change password`.

1. You'll be logged out of the application and you'll be required to login with your new password.

     > Make sure you select `Remember me` option

The ansible script creates some environment types that are the servers that you can launch with two alternatives in memory. If you'd like your users to launch environments with more memory, you can create new items, just changing the `Memory` parameter.

## Trouble shooting

- To re run ansible playbook, log into host and run:

    sudo docker-compose -f 3blades/deployment/docker-compose.yml down

- Then, run ansible playbook as you did before with new settings.
